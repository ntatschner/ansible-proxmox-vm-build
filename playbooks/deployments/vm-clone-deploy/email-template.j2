Hey {{ tower_user_first_name }},

Your VM "{{ tower_user_name }}" has been created,

Here are the details;

Username: {{ tower_user_name }}

IP address: {{ _ip_address | join(', ') }}
External Management URL: https://{{ tower_user_name }}.tatux.in
    Please be aware, there are some issues with Chrome, FireFox seems to work OK.
Password: "Set on template request" - See me for default if not set.

Rebuilt: {{ _awx_rebuild }}

You now need to add the IP address in to the inventory source.
This will allow you to refernce it in an ansible code.
